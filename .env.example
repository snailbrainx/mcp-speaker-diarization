# Speaker Recognition Settings
# Threshold for speaker similarity matching (0.0-1.0, lower = more strict)
# 0.30 = recommended for normal home usage (good balance of accuracy and matching)
# 0.20 = stricter matching for movie audio with background music/effects
SPEAKER_THRESHOLD=0.30

# Context padding around segments for embedding extraction (seconds)
# 0.15s = optimal for movie audio with background music/effects

# Live Recording Settings
# Silence duration before processing segment (seconds)
# Lower = more responsive, but may cut off speech. Higher = more complete segments.
